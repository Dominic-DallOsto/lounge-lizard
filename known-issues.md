This document lists known issues in Lounge Lizard that must be addressed.  In some cases, these are conventional "issues" that 
are bugs.  In other cases, these are simply items that must or should be addressed by those who work on Lounge Lizard in the
future.

**Important note:** There is additional and important information that may guide future work on Lounge Lizard in the [Supported Features](supported-features.md) and [Teams](Teams.md) documents located in this repository.

## General Issues

* **Updates from Wey:** The branch **feature/updates-from-wey** contains the union of all changes made in this repository and all changes made in the original 
Wey repository as of December 2020.  One signficant change coming from the Wey repository is that the Node.js version has been updated 
from v10.x to v12.x.  An important outstanding task is to thoroughly test the code in the **feature/updates-from-wey** branch to ensure 
that all Lounge Lizard functionality is working as expected with both Slack and Microsoft Teams.  Any issues found must be addressed 
before the code in **feature/updates-from-wey** is merged into the **main** branch.

* **Migrate outstanding tasks from Trello to GitHub:**
